# SyncroMSP-Scripts
NOTE: Please test all scripts before deploying. I am not responsible for anything that may go wrong.

I have a large compilation of scripts that I have made as an MSP (over 800 total as of this writing). They may not be the prettiest, but they do work. Most are for Syncro, but can be modified to use in other RMM tools or directly. I will be uploading them over time.

I, by no means have created all of these from scratch, just some. The others are available online and if there are any owners/contributors in the scripts that I acquire and modify, I ALWAYS leave their info in the script. I take no credit for any of my changes to them.

If you have any ideas for some new scripts, I am always up for learning and testing my limits, of course as long as it is a system/software that I have access to for testing.
